Process each point within the search according to the problem type and
algorithm.

individual (evolutionary algorithm)
.generation
.position
.deme
.genome (process according to problem type?)
.fitness (process according to fitness scheme)

Create different views on the same data:
- grouped by deme
- grouped by generation
- grouped by deme and generation
- any view you like
- cache these views

Different analyses on a data set:
- computed using certain views.
- cached, perhaps serialisable
- they can specify which properties they require (check they exist in the
  data set).
- check that data-sets are homogeneous with respect to the analysis.

Pure functional analysis and pure data?
