* Could sub-class Pandas data-frames to add clever functionality.
    * Virtual columns (accessed in the same way)
    * Caching
    * Lazy construction

* Use symbolic regression to find a correlation between evolved difficulty
  measures and "observed" difficulty (num. evaluations, time, num. solutions
  found). Could we normalise between 0.0 and 1.0?
